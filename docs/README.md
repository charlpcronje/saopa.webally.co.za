## Instructions and Generation

The instructions for creating these layout components and the Livewire page components were provided as a series of requirements and specifications. Based on those instructions, the necessary Blade templates, class code, and usage examples were generated.

The Artisan commands provided were used to generate the basic structure of each Livewire component, including the component class and the corresponding Blade view file. The generated files were then customized and updated to meet the specific requirements and design of the application.

The provided code snippets and examples serve as a starting point and can be further customized and extended based on the project's needs.

It's important to note that the generated code assumes the use of Tailwind CSS for styling and Alpine.js for some interactive functionality. Make sure to include these dependencies in your project and adjust the class names and styles according to your project's design system.

Remember to replace the placeholders (e.g., `icon-name`, `/page-url`) with the actual values specific to your application.

By following these instructions and utilizing the provided code snippets, you can create a modular and reusable layout structure for your Laravel application using Livewire components.
